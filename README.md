# Predicting Marketing-Driven Sales and Channel Performance

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of marketing campaigns for tech companies and determining the most effective marketing strategies. By leveraging machine learning models and data science techniques, we aim to:
- Forecast marketing-driven sales.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of various marketing channels.
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing investments and improve ROI.

## 📊 Key Objectives
1. **Forecast Sales**: Predict sales for the next 90 days to assist in inventory planning and sales forecasting.
2. **Compare Marketing Channels**: Assess the performance of different channels to guide budget allocation.
3. **Optimize Campaign Strategies**: Identify the factors driving campaign success and recommend improvements.

## 📁 Data Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:
[Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishabhatt22/marketing-campaign-performance-dataset/data)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Convert categorical data to numerical formats where necessary.
   - Normalize or scale data for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze trends and relationships between features.
   - Visualize campaign effectiveness across channels.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract and create new features relevant to marketing performance, such as ROI and campaign durations.

4. **Modeling**:
   - **Forecasting Sales**: Utilize an LSTM model to predict sales for the next 90 days.
   - **Channel Performance**: Implement a supervised linear regression model to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing channels.

5. **Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Present insights through clear and interactive visualizations to showcase campaign performance and effectiveness.
