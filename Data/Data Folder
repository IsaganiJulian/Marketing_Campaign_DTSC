## 📁 Datasets Overview  

### 1. **Original Dataset**  
- **File Name**: `marketing_campaign_performance.csv`  
- **Source**: Kaggle (Search for "Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset" by Manisha Bhatt)  
- **Description**:  
  - **Samples**: 10,000 rows  
  - **Features**: 43 columns, including engineered interaction features.  
  - **Industry Diversity**: Data spans multiple industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.  
  - **Target Variable**: Conversion rate (success of marketing campaigns).  
- **Issue**:  
  While this dataset was diverse across industries, further exploratory analysis revealed that it did not fully align with the project’s focus on **SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)**. The models built on this dataset underperformed due to a lack of alignment with the targeted audience's unique characteristics.
